This app has a main activity where it gives the user three options of new things to learn.

In the height activity the user enters their height and then it is compared to average men and women's heights.

In the commute activity the user enters the minutes that it takes to get to work and it is compared with the average.

In the facts activity the user can scroll through a list of useless facts.
